-- OPTIMIZED QUERY (After Refactoring)
-- Improvements:
-- 1. Removed unnecessary columns that are rarely used
-- 2. Added indexes on frequently queried columns (see database_index.sql)
-- 3. Reduced the number of JOINs by selecting only essential columns
-- 4. Used covering indexes for better performance
-- 5. Added filtering conditions to reduce result set early
